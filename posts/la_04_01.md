# 4.1 Vector Spaces and Subspaces

## Definition : Vector Space

A **Vector space** is a nonempty set $$V$$ of objects, called **vectors**, 

on which are defined two operations, called
* addition and
* multiplication by scalars (real numbers),

subject to the ten axioms (or rules) listed below.

The **axioms** must hold for all vectors $$\bf{u}$$,$$\bf{v}$$, and $$\bf{w}$$ in $$V$$ for all scalars $$c$$ and $$d$$.

1. The sum of $$\bf{u}$$ and $$\bf{v}$$, denoted by $$\textbf{u}+\textbf{v}$$, is in $$V$$.
2. $$\textbf{u}+\textbf{v} = \textbf{v}+\textbf{u}$$ :commutative
3. $$(\textbf{u}+\textbf{v})+\textbf{w} = \textbf{u} +(\textbf{v}+\textbf{w})$$. :associative
4. There is a **zero** vecot $$\textbf{0}$$ in $$V$$ such that $$\textbf{u}+\textbf{0} = \textbf{u}$$.
5. For each $$\textbf{u}$$ in $$V$$, there is a vector $$-\textbf{u}$$ in $$V$$ such that $$\textbf{u}+(-\textbf{u})=\textbf{0}$$.
6. The scalar multiple of $$\textbf{u}$$ by $$c$$, denoted by $$c\textbf{u}$$, is in $$V$$.
7. $$c(\textbf{u}+\textbf{v}) = c\textbf{u} + c\textbf{v}$$. :distributive
8. $$(c+d)\textbf{u} = c\textbf{u} + d\textbf{u}$$ :distributive
9. $$c(d\textbf{u}) = (cd)\textbf(u}$$. : associative
10. $$1\textbf{u} = \textbf{u}$$

> Scalar를 real number로 제한하지 않고 complex number로 확장할 경우, complex vector space가 되며 $$R$$이 아닌 $$C$$ 상의 vector들을 다루게 된다.

Using these axioms, we can show that 
* the **zero vector** in Axiom 4 is unique, and 
*the vector $$-\textbf{u}$$, called the **negative of $$\textbf{u}$$, in Axiom 5 is **unique** for each $$\textbf{u$$ in $$V$$.

For each $$\textbf{u}$$ in $$V$$ and scalar $$c$$,

$$
0\textbf{u} = \textbf{0} \tag{1} \\
c\textbf{0} = \textbf{0} \tag{2} \\
-\textbf{u} = (-1)\textbf{u} \tag{3} 
$$

## Example 2:

Let $$V$$ be the set of all arrows (directed line segments) in three-dimensional space, 
with two arrows regarded as equal if they have the same length and point in the same direction. 
Define addition by the parallelogram rule, and for each $$\textbf{v}$$ in $$V$$, 
define $$c\textbf{v}$$ to be the arrow whose length is $$\lvbar c \rvbar$$ times the length of $$\textbf{v}$$, 
pointing in the same direction as $$\textbf{v}$$ if $$c \ge 0$$ and 
otherwise pointing in the opposite direction.

See the following figure below. Show that $$V$$ is a **vector space**.

### Solution:

* The definition of $$V$$ is geometric, using concepts of length and direction.
* No *x y z*-coordinate system is invovled.
* An arrow of zero length is a single point and represents the **zero vector**.
* The negative of $$\textbf{v}$$ is $$(-1)\textbf{v}$$.
* So Axioms 1, 4, 5, 6, and 10 are evident. See the figures below.

## Definition

A subspace of a vector space $$V$$ is a subset $$H$$ of $$V$$ that has three properties:

1. The zero vector of $$V$$ is in $$H$$.
2. $$H$$ is closed under vector addtion. That is, for each $$\bf{u}$$ and $$\bf{v}$$ in $$H$$, the sum $$\textbf{u}+\textbf{v]$$ is in $$H$$.
3. $$H$$ is closed under multiplication by scalars. That is, for each $$\bf{u}$$ in $$H$$ and each scalar $$c$$, the vector $$c\textbf{u}$$ is in $$H$$.


* Properties (1), (2), and (3) guarantee that a subspace $$H$$ of $$V$$ is itself a vector space, 
  under the vector space operations already defined in $$V$$.
* Every subspace is a vector space.
* Conversely, every vector space is a subspace (of itself and possibly of other larger spaces).

## A Subspace Spanned by a Set

The set consisting of **only the zero vector** in a vector space $$V$$ is a subspace of $$V$$, called the $$zero subspace** and written as $$\left\{\textbf{0}\right\}$$.

As the term **liniear combination** refers to *any sum of scalar multiples of vectors*, and $$\text{Span }\left\{ \textbf{v}_1,\cdots,\textbf{v}_p\right\}$$ denotes the set of all vectors that can be written as linear combinations of $$\textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p$$.

## Example 10:

Given $$\bf{v}_1$$ and $$bf{v}_2$$ in a vector space $$V$$, let $$H=\text{Span }\left\{\textbf{v}_1, \textbf{v}_2 \rifht\}$$. Show that $$H$$ is a subspace of $$V$$.

### Solution:

* The zero vector is in $$H$$, since $$\textbf{0} = 0\textbf{v}_1 + 0\textbf{v}_2$$.
* To show that $$H$$ is closed uncer vector addition, take two arbitrary vectors in $$H$$, say,

$$
\textbf{u} = s_1 \textbf{v}_1 + s_2 \textbf{v}_2 \text{ and } \textbf{w} = t_1 \textbf{v}_1 + t_2 \textbf{v}_2$$.
$$

* By Axioms 2,3, and 8 for the vector space $$V$$,

$$
\begin{align}
\textbf{u}+\textbf{w} &= (s_1 \textbf{v}_1 +s_2 \textbf{v}_2) + (t_1 \textbf{v}_1 + t_2 \textbf{v}_2) \\
&= (s_1 +t_1)\textbf{v}_1 + (s_2+t_2)\textbf{v}_2
\end{align}
$$

* So $$\textbf{u}+\textbf{v}$$ is in $$H$$.
* Furthermore, if $$c$$ is any scalar, then by Axioms 7 and 9, 
$$
\begin{align}
c\textbf{u} &= c(s_1 \textbf{v}_1 + s_2 \textbf{v}_2)
&=(cs_1)\textbf{v}_1 + (cs_2)\textbf{v}_2
\end{align}
  which shows that $$c\textbf{u}$$ is in $$H$$ and $$H$$ is closed under scalar multiplication.

* Thus $$H$$ is a subspace of $$V$$.

## Theorem 1:

If $$\textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p$$ are in a vector space $$V$$, then $$\text{Span }\left\{ \textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p \right\} is a subspace of $$V$$.

We call $$\text{Span }\left\{ \textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p \right\} **the subspace spanned** (or **generated) by $$\left\{ \textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p \right\}$$.

Give any subspace $$H$$ and $$V$$, a **spanning** (or **generating**) set for $$H$$ is a set $$\left\{ \textbf{v}_1, \cdots, \textbf{v}_p \right\}$$ in $$H$$ such that

$$
H = \text{Span }\left\{ \textbf{v}_1, \cdots \textbf{v}_p \right\}
$$
